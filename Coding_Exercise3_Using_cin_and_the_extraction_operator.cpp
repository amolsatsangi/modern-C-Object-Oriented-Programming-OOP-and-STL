/****************************

Using cin and the extraction operator
In this exercise, you will write code using cin  and the extraction operator >>  to allow a user to enter their date of birth. 


The variable m represents the month, d represents the day, and y represents the year. 
Assume that the user will enter their date of birth in the order of month, day, year, with each value being separated by a blank space.

You do not need to prompt the user for any information using cout

Our test program will automatically 'pretend' to be the user and enter the values 2  15  and 1993  automatically. 


So, your code should consist only of the cin  statement(s). No other code should be necessary.

You can find my solution by clicking on the solution.txt file on the left pane. But please make sure you give it a go yourself first, and only check the solution if you really get stuck.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void date_of_birth() {
    int m {};
    int d {};
    int y {};
    //----DO NOT MODIFY THE CODE ABOVE THIS LINE----
    //---- WRITE YOUR CODE BELOW THIS LINE----
    
    cin >>m>>d >>y;
    
    //---- WRITE YOUR CODE ABOVE THIS LINE----
    //---- Do NOT MODIFY THE CODE BELOW THIS LINE----
    cout << m << " " << d << " " << y;
}
